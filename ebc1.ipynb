    "## Event-based Cameras\n",
    "Event-based Cameras (EBCs) are imaging sensors that respond to local brightness changes. Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, EBCs are asynchronous, having each pixel operating independently from the other. Each pixel reports a change of intensity (if it occurs), or stays silent otherwise. For example, a pixel stores a reference intensity at time $t$, the current intensity is then compared to the reference at time $t + 1$. If the aforementioned difference exceeds the threshold, that pixel outputs an **event**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is a discrete packet of information containing:\n",
    "* Event location ($x$ and $y$ coordinates, across the height and width dimensions respectively).\n",
    "* Event timestamps $t$, the time at which the event occurred.\n",
    "* Event polarity $p$, the direction of intensity change. It does not contain any information regarding intensity values. It is an output spike that can either be $+1$, or $-1$."

    "For the sake of this lab, we will be using the **MVSEC** dataset. The MVSEC dataset is designed for the development of novel 3D perception algorithms for EBCs. In fact, stereo event-based data is collected from cars, motorbikes, hexa-copters and handhelds, fused with LiDAR, IMU, motion-capture and GPS systems to provide ground truth pose and depth images.\n",

    "> **Note:**\n",
    "> You can read more about the \"MVSEC\" dataset [here](https://daniilidis-group.github.io/mvsec/). Before starting this lab, it is important to understand the data structure of MVSEC. This dataset has been taken with a **DAVIS346B** sensor of resolution **(260, 346)**."
